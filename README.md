# Microwave-Landing-System-MLS-
Designed and built an Arduino-based system to simulate Microwave Landing System (MLS) signals (Azimuth, Elevation, Back Azimuth), using real-time amplitude and phase modulation aligned with FAA and ICAO standards; integrated timing control via UTCU and validated signal accuracy through a waveform generator and oscilloscope testing.
